MikeOS -- Open source 16-bit operating system for x86 PCs
Copyright (C) 2006 - 2014 MikeOS Developers -- see doc/LICENSE.TXT
==================================================================


MikeOS is a 16-bit real mode operating system for x86-compatible PCs, 
written entirely in assembly language, which boots from a floppy disk,
CD-ROM or USB key. It features a text-based dialog-driven user
interface, a command-line, support for FAT12 (MS-DOS-like) floppy
disks, sound (PC speaker), text editor, BASIC interpreter and more.
The kernel includes over 60 system calls.

MikeOS is a learning tool for those wishing to understand simple OS 
construction and x86 assembly. Quick getting-started guide: MikeOS can 
run from a floppy disk or CD-ROM, either on an emulator or a real PC. 
See the disk_images/ directory for files that you can write to the 
appropriate media or boot in, for instance, VMware, QEMU or VirtualBox.

You can find the source code in the source/ directory, and sample 
programs (included on the disk images) in the programs/ directory.

+--------------------------+

Tachyon Operating System or TachyonOS for short is a 16-bit x86 operating system.
Copyright (C) TachyonOS Developers 2013

Aims:
 * To provide a small and fast hobby operating system with a variety of external programs.
 * Create a more up-to-date branch of MikeOS. 
	Binary compatibility will be maintained as much as possible while merging new features.
 * Have all my MikeOS application work without kernel mods.

See the commandline guide in the 'doc' folder for information on the commands.
TachyonOS uses the MikeOS API. Information can be found in 'doc/MikeOS'.

Building
========
Run the build script approprate for your operating system to create disk images, i.e. 'build-linux.sh'.
Linux, OSX and OpenBSD users must be logged into as root. 

Requirements:
 - NASM
 - ImDisk (Windows Only)
 - PartCopy (Windows Only)
 - genisoimage (Non-Windows Only but should be installed)

A disk image will be created in the 'disk_images'
folder. This script will compile the kernel and all assembly files in the 'programs' folder.
A floppy disk and ISO image will be create with the bootload, kernel, BASIC programs and binaries 
from 'programs' and all files from 'diskfiles'.


Running
=======
You can use the disk images generated to run MikeOS in an emulator (you may need to change the file
extention of the floppy disk image 'tachyonos.flp' to .img or .ima to run in some emulators) or you
can write to a physical medium such as a floppy disk, CDROM or flash drive (via floppy emulation)
and boot from that. Keep in mind CD's are read only. Linux users with QEMU installed can simple run
the shell script 'test-linux.sh'.
